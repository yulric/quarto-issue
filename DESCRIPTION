Title: Reproduction Case for Quarto renv post render Issue
Version: 0.1.0
Description: This package demonstrates an issue where Quarto's post-render 
    scripts cannot access R libraries installed via renv within a Github 
    action. The post-render script fails to load renv-managed packages despite
    them being available in the R project environment.
